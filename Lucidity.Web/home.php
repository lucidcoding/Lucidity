                    I have been developing software since 2003 across wide ranges of sectors including automotive, manufacturing, financial, legal and government.
                    I have developed systems for a variety of household names including Volkswagen, Nissan, NatWest and Lloyds Bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I offer numerous software development services including:
                </p>

                    My main expertise is in Microsoft based technologies such as .Net, C#, ASP.Net and ASP.Net MVC. I have extensive database skills in a variety of 
                    platforms including Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and NoSQL Databases such as MongoDB and RavenDB. I have considerable experience of Object/Relational Mappers 
                    such as NHibernate and Entity Framework. I also have experience of other languages such as PHP, Ruby and also legacy languages such as VB6 and Classic ASP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked in Agile environments so if this is how you work I can fit straight in. If you do not yet use an Agile methodology but would like some advice on 
                    adopting one, I can also help with this. I also have experience in Test Driven Development and have helped mentor junior developers with this paradigm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if you are using a cutting edge or obsolete technology that no one seems to know, or if you have systems developed in an in-house Domain Specific Language
                    that was only know to one developer (who has since left), then I may be the one person who can make sense of it all.
                </p>
