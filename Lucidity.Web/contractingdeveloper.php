                    The most common service I provide is as an in-office contractor on a daily rate. In this capacity I can help your enterprise
                    in the following ways:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Coding
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you already have a system specified, designed and being built to in-house standards and frameworks, and you need an experinced
                    and front line coder with expertise in a variety of languages and technologies, I can fit in straight away with 
                    your existing practices. Whether you follow a more traditional waterfall based methodology, or if you are a cutting edge Agile house
                    using TDD and Pair Programming, I have experience of all types of environments and can hit the ground running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Consultation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best development departments and companies constantly re-evaluate the practices and technologies they use. Maybe you are not yet
                    using Agile or TDD, and would like an experienced developer to mentor the junior members of your team as you adopt it? Perhaps you have 
                    thought about experimenting with SOA or a Microservice architecture, and would like some advice on implementing it? Or maybe you're suffering
                    from multiple bugs, constantly fire-fighting, and know you need to do something different, but not sure what and need some guidance?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often, the consultation will be on an informal basis combined with my coding service on a standard daily contractor rate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Legacy Systems
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can happen in any business: you have a system that was developed in a language that was discontinued many years ago and no one in the company
                    has any experience of. Or it is configured in a Domain Specific Language that is bespoke to the company and was known only to a developer who 
                    had excellent skills and company knowledge but who unfortunately left years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a lot of experience in this area and I may be the person who can help. I can't promise I will have experience of the obsolete language,
                    but I do have experience of quikly aquiring knowledge of obsolete and proprietory languages.
                </p>
